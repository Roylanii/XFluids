## 1. Manually installed Dependencies
### 1.1. PPA cantera packages (3.1.0 now) is supported 
  ````bash
  sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cantera-team/cantera -y
  sudo apt install libcantera-dev libcantera3.1 -y
  ````
  - ##### If you have another install cantera, please set "CANTERA_ROOT"

    ````bash
    export CANTERA_ROOT=/path/to/cantera
    ````

  - ##### If you want compile cantera form source, please clone canter repository to "./external/cantera" and resolve some dependencies

    ````bash
    cd ./external && git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Cantera/cantera
    ````    

    - install Linux system packages: cmake, scons
    - install [Conda](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/) or [Conda mirror soure for Chinese users](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/archive/) basic environment, at least version 23.9.0
### 1.3. One of the following two SYCL implementations:
  NOTE: SYCL implementation of AdaptiveCpp is strongly recommended for XFluids, and the support of Intel oneAPI will be deprecated.
- #### [AdaptiveCpp](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp)(known as OpenSYCL/hipSYCL) based on [LLVM &gt;= 14.0](https://apt.llvm.org/)
  - ##### An internal AdaptiveCpp can be compiled to SSCP or SSMP(see AdaptiveCpp offical documentation), it is resolved by XFluids automatilly but set "COMPILER_PATH" manually
    - ##### SSCP: Install llvm from org, CUDA/ROCm for NVIDIA/HIP GPUs, and set "COMPILER_PATH" to llvm.
      ````bash
      wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
      chmod +x llvm.sh                  # repalce "<llvm-version>" with number 14/16/18
      sudo ./llvm.sh <llvm-version> all # NOTE That: libclang-<llvm-version>-dev,libomp-<llvm-version>-dev are needed
      export COMPILER_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-<llvm-version>
      ````
    - ##### SSMP: Needn't llvm.org, set system environment "COMPILER_PATH" to CUDA/ROCm.
      ````bash
      export COMPILER_PATH=/path/to/cuda-toolkit # for cuda SSMP AdaptiveCpp compilation
      ````
      ````bash
      export COMPILER_PATH=/path/to/rocm-release # for hip  SSMP AdaptiveCpp compilation
      ````
  - ##### If a system installed AdaptiveCpp is used, please set cmake option "AdaptiveCpp_DIR" or export system environment variables $AdaptiveCpp_DIR.
    ````cmake
    cmake -DAdaptiveCpp_DIR=/path/to/AdaptiveCpp ..
    ````
    ````bash
    export AdaptiveCpp_DIR=/path/to/AdaptiveCpp && \
    cmake ..
    ````

- #### [Intel oneAPI &gt;= 2023.0.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html?operatingsystem=linux&distributions=offline), and [codeplay plugins](https://codeplay.com/solutions/oneapi) are needed for targeting NVIDIA and AMD backends
  - ##### activate environment for oneAPI appended codeplay sultion libs
    ````bash
    source ./scripts/oneAPI/oneapi_base.sh
    ````

## 2. Select target device in SYCL project
### 2.1. Device discovery
### 2.1.1 AdaptiveCpp device discovery: exec "acpp-info" in cmd for device counting
  ```cmd
  $ acpp-info
  =================Backend information===================
  Loaded backend 0(platform_id): OpenMP
    Found device: hipSYCL OpenMP host device
  Loaded backend 1(platform_id): CUDA
    Found device: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070
    Found device: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070
  =================Device information===================
  ***************** Devices for backend OpenMP *****************
  Device 0(device_id)
  ***************** Devices for backend CUDA *****************
  Device 0(device_id)
  ***************** Devices for backend CUDA *****************
  Device 1(device_id)
  ```

### 2.1.2. Intel oneAPI device discovery: exec "sycl-ls" in cmd for device counting
  ```cmd
  $ sycl-ls
  [opencl:acc(platform_id:0):0(device_id)] Intel(R) FPGA Emulation Platform for OpenCL(TM), Intel(R) FPGA Emulation Device 1.2
  [opencl:cpu(platform_id:1):1(device_id)] Intel(R) OpenCL, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor 3.0
  [ext_oneapi_cuda:gpu(platform_id:2):0(device_id)] NVIDIA CUDA BACKEND, NVIDIA T600 0.0 [CUDA 11.5]
  [ext_oneapi_cuda:gpu(platform_id:2):1(device_id)] NVIDIA CUDA BACKEND, NVIDIA T600 0.0 [CUDA 11.5]
  ```

### 2.2. Queue construction: set integer platform_id and device_id("DeviceSelect" in json file or option: -dev)
NOTE: platform_id and device_id are revealed in [2.1-Device-discovery]("2.1. Device discovery")
  ````C++
  auto device = sycl::platform::get_platforms()[platform_id].get_devices()[device_id];
  sycl::queue q(device);
  ````

## 3. Compile and usage of this project
### 3.1. Read root <XFluids/CMakeLists.txt>

- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is set to "Release" by default, SYCL code would target to host while ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}==Debug
- set `INIT_SAMPLE` as the problem being tested, path to "species_list.dat" and "reaction_list.dat" should be given to `MIXTURE_MODEL`
- MPI and AWARE-MPI support added in project, AWARE_MPI need specific GPU-ENABLED mpi version, details referenced in [4-mpi-libs]("4. MPI libs")
- `VENDOR_SUBMIT` allows throwing some parallism tuning cuda/hip model to their GPU, only supportted by AdaptiveCpp compile environment

### 3.2. BUILD and RUN
- build with cmake

  ````bash
  cd ./XFluids
  mkdir build && cd ./build && cmake .. && make -j
  ````
- #### 3.2.1. Local machine running
- XFluids automatically read <XFluids/settings/*.json> file depending on INIT_SAMPLE setting

  ````bash
  ./XFluids
  ````
- Append options to XFluids in cmd for another settings, all options are optional, all options are listed in [6. executable file options]("6. Executable file options")

  ````bash
  ./XFluids -dev=1,1,0
  mpirun -n mx*my*mz ./XFluids -mpi=mx,my,mz -dev=1,0,0
  ````
- #### 3.2.2. Slurm sbatch running on Hygon(KunShan) supercompute center

  ````bash
  cd ./XFluids/scripts/KS-DCU
  sbatch ./1node.slurm
  sbatch ./2node.slurm
  ````

## 4. MPI libs
NOTE: MPI functionality is not supported by Intel oneAPI SYCL implementation
### 4.1. Set MPI_PATH browsed by cmake before build

- cmake system of this project browse libmpi.so automatically in path of ${MPI_PATH}/lib, please export MPI_PATH to the mpi you want:

  ````cmd
  export MPI_PATH=/home/ompi
  ````
### 4.2. The value of MPI_HOME, MPI_INC, path of MPI_CXX(libmpi.so/linmpicxx.so) output on screen while it is found

````cmake
  -- MPI settings:
  --   MPI_HOME:/home/ompi
  --   MPI_INC: /home/ompi/include added
  --   MPI_CXX lib located: /home/ompi/lib/libmpi.so found
````

## 5. .json configure file arguments

- reading commits in src file: <${workspaceFolder}/src/read_ini/settings/read_json.cpp>

## 6. Executable file options

| name of options |                                       function                                       |    type    |

| -mpi-s          |                                  "weak" or "strong"                                  | std::string |
| -mpidbg         |         append the option with or without value to open mpi multi-rank debug         | just append |

## 7. Output data format
NOTE: Output data format is controlled by the value of "OutDAT", "OutVTI" in .json file
### 7.1. Tecplot file

- import .dat files of all ranks of one Step for visualization, points overlapped between boundarys of ranks(3D parallel tecplot format file visualization is not supportted, using tecplot for 1D visualization is recommended)

### 7.2. VTK file

- use `paraview` to open `*.pvti` files for MPI visualization(1D visualization is not allowed, using paraview for 2/3D visualization is recommended);
